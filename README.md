# random-walk-simulator

Iteration 1: random walks on an integer lattice.

This should be a simple web-app where a use can input
- an initial state (starting point)
- the probabilities of moving (up, down, left, right)=(p1,p2,p3,p4) where sum(pi)=100
- the number of iterations, default=1000,

and the simulation is displayed.

Iteration 2: add option for no self intersections.
